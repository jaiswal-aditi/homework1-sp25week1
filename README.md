6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch".
7. Click on "Commit Changes" button. Your code changes have been submitted!

### To check whether your code changes passed:
1. Click on "Actions" on the top.
2. Click on the latest workflow from the list.
3. Click on "Autograding" - you'll see a green check mark or red cross depending on whether your code has successfully passed or not.
4. Expand the desired section. If your code did not pass, you will expand "Run education/autograding@v1" and see the error message.


### Note:
- Github is not a place to test your code. We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly. You should always test on your laptop first, and then copy the finished code to github. Test your program on your machine using the instructions you received in the lab sessions. Test it on your machines first.
- Do not exceed 10 commits. If you exceed 10 commits, your grade will be penalized.
- Do not edit any other files.


If your code did not pass, revise your code and submit(commit) your changes again.

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed.

You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.

For any questions, please reach out to Dr. Katy Tarrit (katytm7@hawaii.edu) AND Aditi Jaiswal (ajaiswal@hawaii.edu)
